In this talk, I will show how to obtain new conclusive results for this problem using nonlinear analysis and convex relaxation techniques. A byproduct of this line of research is an efficient algorithm for determining the optimal distributed Karhunen–Loève transform in the high-resolution regime, which partially settles a question posed by Gastpar, Dragotti, and Vetterli. I will also introduce a generalized version of the Gaussian multiterminal source coding problem where the source-encoder connections can be arbitrary. It will be demonstrated that probabilistic graphical models offer an ideal mathematical language for describing how the performance limit of a generalized Gaussian multiterminal source coding system depends on its topology, and more generally they can serve as the long-sought platform for systematically integrating the existing achievability schemes and converse arguments. The architectural implication of our work for low-latency lossy source coding will also be discussed.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("This talk is based on joint work with Jia Wang, Farrokh Etezadi, and Ashish Khisti.")]),e._v(" "),t("h3",{attrs:{id:"bio："}},[e._v("Bio：")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("Jun Chen received the B.E. degree with honors in communication engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2001 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, in 2004 and 2006, respectively.")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v("He was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Coordinated Science Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, from September 2005 to July 2006, and a Postdoctoral Fellow at the IBM Thomas J.
